In the above code, we first define our Express app and connect to our MongoDB database. We also define our user schema and model using Mongoose.

Next, we define our `generateToken` function, which generates a JWT based on a user's ID. We also define our `/api/authenticate` route, which authenticates a user based on their email and password and returns a JWT.

We then define our `/api/users` route, which creates a new user with an email and hashed password.

The `/api/reset-password` route generates a password reset token, saves it to the user in the database, and sends an email with the token to the user's email address.

Finally, the `/api/reset-password/:token` route resets a user's password based on a password reset token and a new password.

We also start our server and listen on port 3000.

Note that in production, you should store your secret and email credentials securely and not hardcode them in your code like in the above example. Also, you may need to modify the email message format
